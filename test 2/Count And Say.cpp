Write as you speak is a special sequence of strings that starts with string “1” and after one iteration you rewrite the sequence as whatever you speak.

Example :
The first few iterations of the sequence are :
First iteration: “1”
    As we are starting with one.

Second iteration: “11”
    We speak “1” as   “one 1” then we write it as “11”

Third iteration: “21”
    We speak “11” as “Two 1” then we write it as “21”

Fourth iteration: “1211”
    We speak “21” as “one 2, one 1”  then we write it as “1211”

Fifth iteration: “111221”
    We speak “1211” as “one 1, one 2, two 1” then we write it as “111221”

Sixth iteration: “312211”
    We speak “111221” as “three 1, two 2, one 1” then we write it as “312211”


You will be given a single positive integer N, Your task is to write the sequence after N iterations.
