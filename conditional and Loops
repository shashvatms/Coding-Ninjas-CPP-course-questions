0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).
-1, if the character is not an alphabet.





Example:
Input: The character is 'a'.

Output: 0

Explanation: The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.

Input format :
The only line contains a single character.





Output format :
The only line contains 1, 0, or -1 according to the above rules.

Sample Input 1 :
v





Sample Output 1 :
0





Explanation of Sample Input 1:
The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.





Sample Input 2 :
V





Sample Output 2 :
1





Explanation of Sample Input 2:
The input character is uppercase, so our answer is 1.





Sample Input 3 :
#





Sample Output 3 :
-1





Explanation of Sample Input 3:
The input character is not an alphabet, so our answer is -1.





Constraints :
The input can be any single character.
solution:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    char ch;
    // cout << "Enter a character here: " << endl;
    cin >> ch;
    int a = ch;
    if(a>64 and a<92){
        cout << "1" << endl;
    }
    else if(a>96 and a<124){
        cout << "0" <<endl;
    }
    else{
        cout << "-1" << endl;
    }
}
